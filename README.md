# Bibliomate: Library Management System
Bibliomate is a simple program that models a library and its interactions with a student. The program consists of two classes: Library and Student. The Library class manages the available books, with methods like `displayAvailableBooks()`, `lendBook()`, and `addBook()`. These methods display the available books, lend a book to a student, and add a book back to the library when a student returns it, respectively. The Student class, on the other hand, allows students to request books and return them.
