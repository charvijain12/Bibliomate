# Bibliomate: Library Management System 📚🔖

Bibliomate is a simple program that simulates a library's functionalities and interactions with students. It comprises two classes: Library and Student. The Library class manages available books using methods like `displayAvailableBooks()`, `lendBook()`, and `addBook()`, allowing users to view available books, lend books to students, and restock the library's collection, respectively. Meanwhile, the Student class facilitates book requests and returns.
