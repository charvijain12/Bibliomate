# Library Management System
This is a simple program that models a library and its interactions with a student. The program has two classes: Library and Student. The Library class has several methods such as `displayAvailablebooks()`, `lendBook()`, and `addBook()` which display the available books in the library, lend a book to a student, and add a book to the library when a student returns it, respectively. The Student class has two methods `requestBook()` and `returnBook()` which allow a student to request or return a book. The `main()` function provides a menu-based interface to interact with the library. The user can choose to display available books, request a book, return a book, or exit the program.
